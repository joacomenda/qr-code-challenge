## My process

- First I created a div that will contain my qr image and the text underneath, the text is contained by another div
- Then I contained the div inside another div, this because I wanted to use a flexbox the center horizontally the div that contains the qr and the text
- The div that contains the qr image and the text is a flexbox that I set to flex:column
- Then I styled the qr and text container, I added the flexbox to display the 3 items vertically and added a border, color and shadows
- The image I set its width to 100% so it can cover the entire container horizontally, i used padding on the container so I can put some space, then I added borders to the image
- The I styled the text, added color, the fonts and the font-size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to center a div horizontally using flexbox

### Continued development

I struggled with the centering of the container, I'm still learning how to center it using multiple flexboxes so it can scale on desktop and mobile

### Useful resources

- [Bro Code](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw) - This helped me with adding shadows and the flexbox
